    Oracle Red Bull Racing came into existence late in 2004 – under the guidance of Team Principal Christian Horner – with ambitions to challenge for race victories and world championship titles.<br>
    The Team finished seventh in 2005 and 2006. The initial driver line-up was a mix of youth and experience: David Coulthard provided the latter, while Christian Klien, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Robert Doornbos were the former. DC scored the Team’s first podium, finishing third in Monaco in 2006. <br>
    For 2007 Mark Webber came onboard to join DC. The Team finished fifth in 2007 but dropped back to seventh again in 2008 – but everything was going to change in 2009. <br>
    Coulthard retired at the end of 2008 to be replaced by Sebastian Vettel. Seb’s arrival coincided with a major reset in the sport’s aerodynamic regulations. The new rules gave the Technical Team the chance to shine. In the RB5 they produced a winner. Vettel took the Team’s first victory, leading home Webber in a 1-2 finish at the Chinese Grand Prix. The car would win five more times in 2009, including Webber’s debut F1 victory at the Nürburgring. The Team finished second in the Constructors’ Championship but, perhaps more significantly, it won the final three races of the season.<br>
    History was made in 2010. Driving the RB6, Webber and Vettel were title contenders from the start. Their consistent podium finishes secured the Constructors’ Championship at the penultimate round in Brazil. Both drivers went to the final race in Abu Dhabi with a shot at the Drivers’ crown. Vettel emerged triumphant, winning the race to become the sports’ youngest ever World Champion.<br>
    The Red Bull RB7 and Vettel dominated 2011. He took 11 of the Team’s dozen victories and took his second Drivers’ title with four races to spare. The Constructors’ title was confirmed with three races still to go.<br>
    The competition fought back in 2012, the first seven races went to seven different winners representing five different manufacturers. Red Bull Racing kicked on in the second half of the season and four consecutive victories saw Vettel emerge as a strong title contender. Those wins also propelled the Team to a significant lead in the Constructors’ Championship. Both titles were clinched by the season’s end.<br>
    In 2013 the RB9 looked like the class leader – but somehow never seemed to produce what it promised. That changed after the mid-season break when Vettel went on the rampage, setting a new record for consecutive victories – nine! Both titles were secured with three races to spare.<br>
